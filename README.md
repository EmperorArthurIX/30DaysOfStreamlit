# 30 Days of Streamlit

I have always loved working with Streamlit, ever since I first discovered it.

The **30 Days of Streamlit** Challenge by [The Data Professor](https://youtube.com/dataprofessor) is one of the most exciting experiences I have had, and I would recommend everyone reading this to have a go at it as well!


## The Challenge

The **30 Days of Streamlit** Challenge is a campaign by Streamlit, in collaboration with Mr. Chanin Nantasenamat, also known as *The Data Professor*, to help interested people get involved in creating applications using the powerful and flexible Streamlit API and deploy them on Streamlit Cloud!

## My take on the challenge

I fell in love with the idea of a consistency challenge related to the Python module I use extensively; thus, I am going to document each of the 30 days of the challenge in this repository, summarising key moments of learning from the day's work.


## My Goals

By taking up the challenge, I wish to accomplish the following goals:

- Become proficient in using the various attributes and features offered by Streamlit
- Increase speed and efficiency while using Python, especially when working with Streamlit and related modules from my domain of interest
- Develop and maintain consistency, not just through the challenge but also after the challenge is over
- Learn about the best practices for application deployment on Streamlit Cloud

<h3> Task Summary </h3>

- Set up a virtual environment
    
    Open Command Prompt where you want to create the environment and set up a virtual environment called `.env` in local machine (Windows)
    ```
    python -m venv .env
    ```
- Activate the environment
    
    In the same folder, activate the environment using the following command:
    ```
    .env\Scripts\activate
    ```
- Install Streamlit
    
    Once the environment is activated, the name of the environment will appear before the root directory of the folder on Command Prompt. Install Streamlit here
    ```
    pip install streamlit
    ```
